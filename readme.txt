For my project, I used pygame. In order to install pygame, either go on pygame.com and install from there or pip install pygame. 

My project is split into two parts. The first part is an interactive starfield which allows the user to play with the pseudo-3D perspective. It is just a cool ps The second part is a 3rd person, pseudo-3D space shooter. You play from the perspective of the ship, shooting enemies and leveling up. The goal of this game is just to get a high score. 

To play the game, run TermProjectPYGAME4.0
